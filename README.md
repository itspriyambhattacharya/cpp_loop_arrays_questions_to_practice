# C++ Practice Questions for Arrays, Loops, and Vectors

This repository contains a curated set of C++ practice problems focused on arrays, loops, and vectors. These exercises are designed to help students solidify their understanding of fundamental C++ concepts and improve their problem-solving skills.

These questions are ideal for those who are just getting started with the language and aim to build a strong foundation.

## Introduction

The repository contains various problems that involve:

- Basic loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Operations on vectors and arrays
- Problem-solving using conditions and loops
- Practical exercises that build an intuitive understanding of data structures in C++

Each problem has been carefully designed to help students understand:

- Iterating through data structures
- Managing collections of elements (vectors)
- Applying control structures (loops, conditions) effectively

## Problem List

1. **Sum Calculation Using `while` Loop**  
   Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.

2. **Count Down and Store in Vector**  
   Use a `while` loop to count down from 5 to 1 and store the result in a vector.

3. **Collect User Inputs with `do-while`**  
   Accept multiple user inputs until the user opts to stop, storing the values in a vector.

4. **Sum Numbers Using `do-while`**  
   Add numbers from 1 to 4 using a `do-while` loop and store the result.

5. **Multiply Array Elements by 2**  
   Use a `for` loop to multiply each element of the array `[2, 5, 8, 9]` by 2.

6. **Copy Elements of a List**  
   Write a `for` loop to copy elements of the list `[2, 5, 6, 1, 4, 7]` into another list.

7. **Stop Iteration on a Specific Condition**  
   Iterate over a vector `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and stop the loop when the number 7 is found.

8. **Skip a Value During Iteration**  
   Iterate over a vector `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`, skipping the number 3, and store the rest in a new vector.

9. **Conditional Multiplication of Array Elements**  
   Iterate over an array `[2, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, skip the value 6, and multiply the remaining elements by 2.

10. **Check if an Array is Empty**  
    Write a condition to check if a given array is empty or not.

11. **Add Element to the End of an Array**  
    Write a `for` loop to add the number 125 to the array `[1, 4, 6]`.

12. **Remove the Last Element of an Array**  
    Write a `for` loop to remove the last element from the array `[6, 8, 2, 1]`.

Each problem is accompanied by example code and explanations, ensuring students can follow along and understand the thought process behind each solution.
